# Crowd-Sourced EV Charging Network

Welcome to our Crowd-Sourced EV Charging Network, a revolutionary solution to make electric vehicle (EV) charging accessible, affordable, and sustainable for everyone.

Instead of waiting for governments or big corporations to build charging stations, we empower everyday people and small businesses to list their EV chargers on our network. Think of it as Airbnb for EV chargers, transforming unused chargers into valuable resources for EV owners everywhere.

## How It Works

Our platform connects:
	•	EV Owners: Find chargers nearby anytime, even in remote areas or on highways.
	•	Charger Owners: Earn extra income by renting out your charger to EV users.

## Benefits for Everyone

For EV Owners
	•	No Range Anxiety: Easily locate chargers, even in smaller towns, villages, or tourist spots.
	•	Convenience: No need to rely solely on expensive, hard-to-find public charging infrastructure.

## For Charger Owners
	•	Earn Income: Turn your unused EV charger into a money-making asset.
	•	Flexibility: Whether you’re a homeowner or small business owner, join the network easily.

## For the Environment
	•	Promotes Clean Energy: Encourages solar-powered chargers and makes EVs more accessible.
	•	Reduces Pollution: Supports the widespread adoption of eco-friendly transportation.

## Why Crowd-Sourced Charging?

We believe in a people-first, scalable approach:
	•	No New Infrastructure: Taps into chargers already owned by individuals or businesses.
	•	Works Anywhere: Accessible in cities, villages, highways, or remote areas.
	•	Scalable & Flexible: Anyone with a charger can join, growing the network effortlessly.
	•	Accelerates EV Adoption: Makes EVs more practical and affordable.

## Future Implementation: Real-Time Tracking & Scheduling App

Our upcoming app will further simplify EV charging:
	•	Real-Time Charger Tracking: Just like Zomato shows restaurants, our app will display all available chargers nearby.
	•	Pre-Booking: Reserve a time slot to avoid waiting.
	•	Example: A delivery driver in Ahmedabad can pre-book a charger at a local shop during their break.
